The landscape of web development has changed dramatically over the past decade, evolving from simple HTML pages with inline CSS and JavaScript to complex single-page applications built with sophisticated frameworks, bundlers, and an ever-growing ecosystem of tools that can be overwhelming for newcomers trying to figure out where to start.

## The Framework Explosion

Every year brings new JavaScript frameworks promising to solve all the problems of the previous generation, and while this constant innovation drives the industry forward and gives us better tools to work with, it also creates a phenomenon known as "JavaScript fatigue" where developers feel exhausted trying to keep up with the latest trends and best practices that seem to change every few months.

React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid, Qwik, and countless other frameworks each have their own philosophies about how web applications should be built, their own ecosystems of supporting libraries, their own build tools and configuration requirements, and their own communities of developers who will passionately argue that their chosen framework is the best solution for every possible use case.

## The Build Tool Maze

Modern web development often requires a complex build pipeline that includes transpilers like Babel to convert modern JavaScript to older versions for browser compatibility, bundlers like Webpack, Rollup, or Vite to combine modules and optimize assets, CSS preprocessors or post-processors, TypeScript compilers, linting tools, testing frameworks, and deployment automation that all need to be configured and maintained.

## Back to Basics

Sometimes the best approach is to step back and remember that not every project needs the latest cutting-edge framework with server-side rendering, static site generation, incremental static regeneration, edge functions, and real-time data synchronization when a simple static HTML file served from a basic web server would accomplish the same goal with far less complexity, maintenance burden, and potential points of failure.
