Software development is both an art and a science. Here are some principles I try to follow when building software.

## Keep It Simple

Complexity is the enemy of reliability. Always start with the simplest solution that could work, and only add complexity when necessary.

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Leonardo da Vinci

## Write Clean Code

Code is read more often than it's written. Make your code self-documenting:

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Comment the "why", not the "what"

## Test Early, Test Often

Automated tests give you confidence to refactor and improve your code. A good test suite is invaluable.

## Learn Continuously

The tech landscape is always evolving. Stay curious and never stop learning!
